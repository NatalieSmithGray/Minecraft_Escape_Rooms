## Welcome to Dr. SG's Minecraft Escape Room

The following file must be run on the version **1.20.4**. Work is being done to update it to work on the latest snapshot.

- Ensure that you are in adventure mode
- Ensure that your inventory is empty at the start
- You can take things from chests, barrels, and pots (except for the ferns which are meant to be decor).

These escape rooms were created by Nathan Gray and Natalie Smith-Gray. 

We hope you enjoy!
